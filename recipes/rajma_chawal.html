        <h2>Decription:</h2>
    <p>This is a Punjabi household favourite. Growing up in my parents home, this dish was often on the menu for our much anticipated Saturday lunch. When Rajma Chawal was prepared at our school cafeteria the news would spread like wildfire and we would rush to the lunch hall with excitement. This is one of those dishes where you can easily say "Everybody loves Rajma Chawal".

        Think of this as North India's 'Chili sin Carne' but one where you won't miss the meat at all.
        
        Always served with jeera rice and optionally with some yoghurt and fresh onion slices.</p>
